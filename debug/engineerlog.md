### 2026-06-08 — v1.0.000 Initial Release
**Author:** aldobox
**Scope:** Entire repository scaffolding (`install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, wrappers, desktops, icons, docs)
**Trigger:** User requested a clean, legal replacement for a third-party Office 365 Linux installer that contained known piracy artifacts (`ohook`).

#### Changes
- [x] Created `install.sh` — 8-phase orchestrator (Dependencies → Wine Prefix → Browser Prompt → Official Installer → Launchers → Desktop Integration → Fonts/MIME → Test Launch)
- [x] Created `uninstall.sh` — safe removal with process-kill guards (`pkill -9` for wineserver, wine, and all Office EXEs)
- [x] Created 8 wrapper scripts in `wrappers/` (`word365.sh` through `teams365.sh`)
- [x] Created 8 `.desktop` files in `desktops/` with MIME associations
- [x] Created 8 brand-color SVG placeholders in `icons/` (256×256)
- [x] Added professional repository files: `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.gitignore`
- [x] Added `docs/troubleshooting.md` with common failure modes

#### Issues Found / Fixed
- **Issue:** Original third-party guide referenced `drive_c/ohook` — a known activation bypass/crack tool.
  - Root cause: The Google Drive archive distributed pre-activated (pirated) Office binaries.
  - Fix: Replaced the entire approach. Instead of importing a pre-built Wine prefix, the installer now creates a **clean** prefix and opens the user's browser to `https://www.office.com` to download the **official** Microsoft installer.
- **Issue:** No automated Wine prefix sanitization in the original guide.
  - Root cause: The original script blindly copied an unknown filesystem tree into `$HOME`.
  - Fix: `install.sh` unconditionally removes any existing `~/.Microsoft_Office_365` and rebuilds it from scratch via `wineboot --init`.

#### Service State
- No persistent services. Pure Bash/Wine user-space tool.

### 2026-06-08 — Repository Professionalization
**Author:** aldobox
**Scope:** GitHub repo `aldobox/Office365LinuxInstaller`, local path `~/Desktop/Development/Apps/Office-365-Linux/`
**Trigger:** User requested GitHub publication with MIT licensing, version tag, and professional documentation.

#### Changes
- [x] Created private GitHub repository via API
- [x] Force-pushed canonical commit `fc54150` (overrode auto-generated license template commit)
- [x] Tagged `v1.0.000` and pushed to origin
- [x] Sanitized all absolute paths (`/home/ciro/` replaced with `$HOME` / `$USER`)
- [x] Removed token from Git remote URL after push (security hygiene)
- [x] Updated local XFCE app menu entry (`~/.local/share/applications/mso365-installer.desktop`) to point to new local repo path
- [x] Created `debug/` folder with `engineerlog.md`, `context.md`, and nested `.gitignore`

#### Issues Found / Fixed
- **Issue:** Git push over HTTPS failed because the TTY-less environment could not prompt for credentials.
  - Root cause: `git push https://github.com/...` requires interactive username/password input.
  - Fix: Temporarily embedded the PAT into the remote URL (`https://aldobox:<token>@github.com/...`), pushed, then immediately reverted the remote URL to the clean form.

#### Service State
- GitHub API: responsive
- Local repo: clean working tree, `main` tracking `origin/main`

## Decision Registry

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Reversible |
|----|----------|-----------|------------|
| D001 | Use MIT License | Maximally permissive for a deployment helper; compatible with all downstream uses | Yes — re-license requires contributor consent |
| D002 | `win64` WINEARCH default | Modern Office 365 is 64-bit; 32-bit prefix deprecated | No — changing would break installed Office |
| D003 | `crossover` user folder name | Matches original structure for compatibility with existing Wine prefixes | Yes — can rename if needed |
| D004 | SVG placeholders instead of official Microsoft logos | Avoids trademark infringement; placeholders are original artwork | Yes — can swap for Fluent UI icons later |
| D005 | No bundled `Setup.exe` | Legal compliance — we never redistribute Microsoft binaries | No — this is a core project tenet |

## Rollback Procedures

### Revert to Pre-v1.0.000
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Development/Apps/Office-365-Linux
git reset --hard fc54150^   # only if you kept a backup branch
git push origin main --force
```

### Remove from System Completely
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Development/Apps/Office-365-Linux
./uninstall.sh
rm -rf ~/Desktop/Development/Apps/Office-365-Linux
rm ~/.local/share/applications/mso365-installer.desktop
```

## 2026-06-09 — v1.0.101 ODT Patch Release
**Author:** aldobox
**Scope:** `install.sh` only (Phase D + Phase I + URL updates)
**Trigger:** User discovered `OfficeSetup.exe` is actually the Office Deployment Tool (ODT), not a self-running installer. Running it bare under Wine caused COM/DCOM crashes (`0x80004002`).

#### Changes
- [x] Rewrote `phase_d_install_office()` to generate ODT `configuration.xml` on-the-fly (`en-GB`, `O365ProPlusRetail`, silent install)
- [x] Added cache detection: skips `/download` if `~/Downloads/OfficeCache/` already exists and is non-empty
- [x] Phase D now runs two explicit ODT commands:
  1. `wine OfficeSetup.exe /download /tmp/o365_configuration.xml`
  2. `wine OfficeSetup.exe /configure /tmp/o365_configuration.xml`
- [x] Added `phase_i_cleanup()` — terminal prompt `[y/n]` at end of installation to delete `OfficeCache/` + temp files
- [x] Updated all browser URLs from `office.com` to `microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/download-office`
- [x] Updated Phase C prompt text to match ODT download instructions

#### Issues Found / Fixed
- **Issue:** Running `wine OfficeSetup.exe` without arguments crashed Wine with `err:ole:marshal_object Failed to create an IRpcStubBuffer`.
  - Root cause: The ODT has no GUI mode under Wine; it requires `/download` or `/configure` flags.
  - Fix: Explicit ODT command-line workflow with XML configuration.

#### Service State
- No persistent services. Pure Bash/Wine user-space tool.
- Version bumped from `1.0.000` → `1.0.101`

## Notes for Future Agents

- Always verify `bash -n` on any `.sh` file before committing.
- Never add `ohook`, `kms`, or any activation tool references.
- If updating Wine registry settings, always test with `wine wineboot -u`.
- Before modifying `dosdevices` symlinks, kill all Wine processes to prevent dangling file handles.
